# Copilot instructions

1. Read the azmcp-commands.md and find all entries which don't have a cooresponding JSON object(s) in tools.json.
2. Create those entries in the tools.json.
3. Take the new entries in the tools.json to create a new file documentation file for each new server in the tools.json. Follow the format of the azure-app-confguration.md to create each new server's doc fil
4. For any new tools in existing servers, create the markdown files with just the new information so I can copy/paste it into the existing document which isn't in this workspace.
