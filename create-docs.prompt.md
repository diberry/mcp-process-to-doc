# Copilot instructions

1. Read the azmcp-commands.md at this [URL](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/docs/azmcp-commands.md) and find all entries which don't have a corresponding JSON services or tools in tools.json at this [URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-mcp-server/tools/tools.json).
2. Copy over the tools.json to this project's root and create those entries in the local tools.json file.
3. Find each new tools primary documentation page on Microsoft Learn, if it exists, and add the  documentation URL to the new entry in the tools.json file. If it doesn't exist, leave the documentation URL blank. Use this documentation to understand branding and terminology specific to this tool that should be used in the documentation file for the mcp server you generate. Neither the azmcp-commands.md or the tools.json has the branding information required to create the new documentation files. Use the branding information from the existing documentation files in this workspace to create the new documentation files. Use the Azure Learn knowledge service tool to get that important branding information.
4. Take the new entries in the local tools.json to create a new file documentation file for each new server in the tools.json. Plac those files in a timestamped directory. Follow the format of the azure-app-confguration.md at this [URL](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-mcp-server/tools/app-configuration.md) to create each new server's doc file. Notice any relative or absolute links in the app-configuration.md file that you should mimic in the new files. 
5. For any new tools in existing servers, create the markdown files with just the new information so I can copy/paste it into the existing document which isn't in this workspace. Name the file with a postfix of `-partial` so I know it isn't the whole file.
6. If a tool is specific to a 3rd party but the server is Azure Native ISV, use the 3rd party tool branding only in that tool's section. Datadog is an example of this. The server name should be azure-native-isv and the tool name should be the 3rd party name, like `datadog` in this case.
7. Update ALL navigation and landing page files to include the new services. Provide the complete updated versions of the following files with the new servers/tools added following the existing format and alphabetical ordering:
    * [Main landing page](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-mcp-server/index.yml) - Add to tools reference section. The landing page has a list of the first 5 tools in alpha order than a link to the rest. Don't have more than 4 individual tools listed in the landing page.
    * [MCP tools TOC](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-mcp-server/TOC.yml) - Add navigation entries
    * [MCP available server tools include](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-dev-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-mcp-server/includes/tools/supported-azure-services.md) - Add service descriptions
8. Ensure all links to Learn documentation is relative and not absolute. For example, use `../get-started.md` instead of `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mcp-server/get-started.md`. Any URLs which aren't in `/azure/developer` need a non-relative and non-absolutepath such as `/azure/...`. It also must not include the language code like `en-us` in the URL. It should be relative to the current file. Test the links to ensure they work correctly.
9. You don't need to add ms.custom for build 2025 as that is a past event. It is not needed for the new files.
10. tools.json.bak is a backup file which may include existing PRs of content which haven't been merged yet. Do not edit it. It is used to restore the tools.json if needed.
