Python Analysis Logic (Embedded)
The automation embeds complete Python analysis code that should:

Parse azmcp-commands.md for function patterns: mcp_azure_mcp_ser_azmcp-*
Load existing functions from tools.json
Calculate set difference to find new functions
Generate formatted new.md report
Success Criteria Met vs. Outstanding
‚úÖ Working Components
File upload/download system
Thread persistence and reset functionality
File extraction from text responses
Timestamped run organization
Agent creation and configuration
‚ùå Critical Issues
Agent not executing Python code - Returns examples instead of real analysis
No actual function discovery - Placeholder data (X, Y, Z) instead of real counts
üìä Current Results
The latest run did succeed in generating a real new.md file with:

70 total functions found in azmcp-commands.md
38 existing functions in tools.json
32 new functions discovered
Complete list of specific function names
Recommended Next Steps
Investigate why some runs succeed while others fail - The latest run actually worked correctly
Add run step event logging to track code interpreter tool usage
Simplify agent instructions to be more explicit about code execution requirements
Add validation to verify agent actually executed code vs. provided examples
Implement retry logic for failed code executions
Persistence Design Assessment
The current persistence design is functionally sound but complex:

Pros: Comprehensive state tracking, historical preservation, flexible continuation
Cons: Multiple storage locations, complex extraction logic, fragile regex patterns
Alternative: Direct file generation via agent file outputs instead of text parsing
The system successfully demonstrates that AI agents can maintain state across runs and process engineering data to generate documentation, but reliability varies based on agent execution behavior.
